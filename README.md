## User Story
As a product manager, I want a developer profile generator, so that I can easily gather and provide a resume on a specific developer.

## Usage
Upon the start of the application, a prompted will appear for users to enter a github username and their favorite color. Once both prompts are answered, the html and pdf file is generated, and a confirmation message will appear!
